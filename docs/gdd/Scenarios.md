# Scenarios

A sandbox-only director that gives every session a crisis to live through: at
startup it picks one **arc** (a plausible 1930s conflict), rolls its target
variant, seeds the aggressor against its targets, and runs a three-rung ladder
that pushes the AI toward war. The player either gets drawn in or watches the
world burn. The system is designed to reuse the other sandbox mechanics (Honor,
Tyranny, Rivals, Civil Wars, National Focuses) rather than add new ones.

This is the Rt56 mod. The vanilla mod (`_sandbox`) shares the engine and most
documentation; this file describes what is specific to the Rt56 overlay.

## Design goals

1. Make sessions alarming: an arc must, on a random draw, drive a major war.
2. Leave the player free: the director pushes AI, not the human; the player can
   join, meddle, or sit it out.
3. No new PM-level systems: reuse existing modifiers and hooks.
4. Stay legible: every mechanism logs to `game.log` under `#sandbox` for
   observer sessions.

## Selection

One arc per session, chosen at startup: pinned by a game rule or rolled at
random over the arcs whose aggressor exists. Arc ids are fixed per major
(1 GER, 2 ITA, 3 JAP, 4 SOV, 5 FRA, 6 ENG); the USA arc is an authored draft,
not in the shipped pool. The pick rolls the A/B target variant 50/50 and logs
`sc_pick` plus `sc_variant`.

### Pool and selection

- Random sessions pick from the pool with equal weights, over arcs whose
  aggressor exists. Pin options exist for all six.
- A derail repicks the next eligible never-derailed arc; a derailed arc never
  re-enters the pool in the same session.
- Target variants are rolled at pick (50/50) and remain fixed for the session.

### Excluded majors

- **HUN**: the Habsburg restoration arc is out of scope for this pool by user
  decision; its focuses do exist should it be added later.
- **USA**: the fascist-America arc is authored as a spec (`draft`, no arc id)
  but is not in the shipped pool.

## Arc schema

Each arc is described by one TOML **arc spec** in `docs/scenarios/<id>.toml`
(one per arc per mod). Shared tooling reads the specs and derives the catalog,
the focus diagrams, the focus-boost closure and the expected telemetry labels;
scripted events and effects stay hand-written in the HSL catalog.

```toml
id = "axis_expansion"       # slug; identity and file name
number = 1                  # the director's arc id; written when the arc has code
status = "ready"            # ready (in the shipped pool) | draft (authored, not selected)
aggressor = "GER"           # a single tag
key = "axis"                # short slug for the pin trigger and pick label; optional

targets = { a = ["CZE", "POL"], b = ["FRA", "ENG"] }  # target variants, rolled evenly
suppress = ["GER_austria_first"]  # optional: focus ids the AI must not pick while the arc is live

[ladder]                    # months from arc start
crises_at_month = 12
peak_at_month = 24
# Content rungs (optional pair): hand-written functions the tick calls.
# Both or neither; absent means the arc has no generated tick branch yet.
crises_func = "sandbox_fire_axis_crises"
peak_func = "sandbox_fire_axis_peak"

[joiners]                   # shared scorer, no per-arc parameters
select = "top_n_by_scorer"
n = 2

[gate]                      # optional; absent means no gate
# Derail pair (optional): park the arc when the aggressor is off ideology.
ideology = "fascism"
at_phase = "crises"
# Hold set (optional, all three together): freeze the arc clock while the
# aggressor is not yet on hold_ideology, then run the ladder; if it never
# changes, park the arc after hold_max_months months with hold_reason.
hold_ideology = "neutrality"
hold_max_months = 30
hold_reason = "no_regime_change"

# Ordered focus paths: each table runs from a branch entry to a war leaf and
# declares the variants it serves (absent means shared across all variants).
[[paths]]
focuses = ["GER_remilitarize_the_rhineland", "GER_anschluss", "GER_demand_sudetenland"]

# Optional `after`: gate this path's boost on the listed focuses being done, so
# a later stage waits for an earlier path. Shared ancestors stay ungated.
[[paths]]
after = ["GER_anschluss"]
focuses = ["GER_austria_first"]

```

Top-level keys come before `[table]` headers: in TOML everything after a
header belongs to that table. `id` must match the file name; `number` is
unique and must match the code dispatcher; a `ready` arc requires a `number`.
Every key focus must exist in the aggressor's focus graph. The ladder content
functions come as an optional pair (`crises_func` + `peak_func` naming the
hand-written rung functions); absent means no generated tick branch. The
optional `key` names the pin trigger suffix and pick label; absent means no
generated pick data. Every variant holds 1-4 targets (the derail arms cover
that range). Every `targets` key is covered by at least one path; every listed
`variants` entry is a `targets` key. Boosts follow the live variant: shared
focuses stay boosted whenever the aggressor is live, path-specific focuses
only while their variant runs, and an entry's optional `after` holds its boost
back until every listed focus is completed (shared ancestors of a gated path
stay ungated). The peak rung waits for the AI to complete
the last focus of the live path (humans proceed on schedule), with a
fallback twelve months past the peak month; put rarely-bypassed focuses
last, since a bypassed tail stalls to the fallback. The optional `suppress`
list closes focuses for the AI while the aggressor is live
(`$ai_scenario_focus_suppress()`, factor 0); a suppressed id must exist in the
graph and must not be a key focus, so suppressing a fork forces the AI onto a
sibling (issue 33: the SOV purge-opposition forks, leaving `the_centre`). There
is no `type`, `block` or `content_refs` field. The optional `gate` table either
holds the arc until a regime flip (the `hold_*` trio) or carries the derail
pair (`ideology`/`at_phase`); the hold freezes `arc_months` at zero while the
aggressor is off `hold_ideology` and parks the arc with `hold_reason` once
`hold_max_months` held months pass, so a ladder whose premise is a regime
change never fires into the old regime. A hold needs the ladder content pair
(its tick is where the rungs live).

## Ladder

| Rung | Fires at | Releases |
|---|---|---|
| smolder | month 0 | seed only |
| crises | month 12 | crisis events (claims, incidents) |
| peak | month 24 | ultimatums to targets, join offers |

The template calendar (smolder 36.1.1 / crises 37.1.1 / peak 38.1.1) is what
vanilla arcs use; later arcs may shift the rungs.

## Levers

**Rivals and antagonism**: the director seeds each aggressor-target pair as a
national rival at 65 and injects rivalry at the crises phase, so the existing
AI weights push war planning. Rivalry is the main lever; no new AI code.

**Focus weights**: `$ai_scenario_focus_boost()` (x5, live aggressor only) is
spliced onto the arc's war focuses and their branch roots, so the AI actually
walks the war branch (the s10 lesson: a boost behind an unboosted fork is dead).
Which focuses each arc boosts is drawn per arc in
`docs/gdd/Scenarios Catalog.md`. The spec's `suppress` list adds
`$ai_scenario_focus_suppress()` (factor 0) to focuses the arc closes, so a
wrong fork cannot win the AI's pick even before the boost applies.

**Join levers**: at peak the two highest-scoring outsiders (`scenario_join_scorer`)
get a bloc invitation. The scorer gates on ideology and hostility and scores
strength plus goodwill; a joiner leaves its old faction first (no Honor charge).

**Ultimatum casus belli**: a refused peak ultimatum must give the aggressor a
wargoal (`create_wargoal`), or ignition waits on the AI's own war decision and
can miss the `peak_timeout`. Arcs war through their ultimatum events, not
wargoals on the focus tree (issue 34).

## Lifecycle

The arc ends at **ignition**: any war between declared scenario enemies, in
either direction, detected at declaration or by the monthly ongoing-war sweep.
Ignition logs `sc_ignite` + `sc_success` + `sc_end`.

**Derail** parks a dead arc at phase 3: the aggressor is gone, capitulated, or
has been in a protracted civil war (12 months); no viable target remains; or the
arc has sat at peak for 12 months without ignition (`peak_timeout`). On random a
derail repicks; pinned sessions go quiet.

## Hooks and telemetry

- Tick: `on_startup` (selection) plus `on_weekly` / `on_monthly`. `on_monthly`
  runs per country, so the ladder tick fires in exactly one host per month: HAI
  is the primary host with a fallback chain through the majors.
- Reactions: `on_declare_war` (ignition), `on_annex` / `on_capitulation`
  (derail), `on_join_allies` / `on_join_faction` (joiner tracking).
- Telemetry: `sc_pick`, `sc_variant`, `sc_seed`, `sc_phase`, `sc_crisis`,
  `sc_target`, `sc_power`, `sc_goal`, `sc_justify`, `sc_goal_end`, `sc_focus`,
  `sc_offer`, `sc_ignite`, `sc_success`, `sc_join`, `sc_end`, `sc_derail`,
  `sc_repick`. Per-actor lines are gated on `is_scenario_actor` (aggressor or a
  declared target), so an unrelated country's focus does not pollute the arc.

### Sampling cadence

A recurring state is sampled on a schedule; a transition is logged when it
happens. The s7 diagnostic package follows this rule:

| Line | Cadence |
| --- | --- |
| `sc_power` | monthly per live actor |
| `sc_goal` | monthly per declared pair with a held wargoal or an active justification |
| `sc_justify` | monthly per declared pair with an active justification |
| `sc_goal_end` | on wargoal expiry (transition) |

`sc_justify` used to ride the daily justification pulse (one line per day per
justification); since issue 15 it is a monthly sample like the rest of s7, so
a long justification costs lines per month, not per day.

### Telemetry label convention

`sc_goal` and `sc_justify` carry one label per aggressor/target pair, always
`<aggressor>_on_<target>` in **lowercase** (`ger_on_cze`, `hun_on_rom`). The
catalog writes both label sets by hand in the s7 telemetry; both must
match exactly, or one arc reads as two keys when a session is grepped.

- `sc_goal` logs wargoals in **both** directions, so it also holds
  `<target>_on_<aggressor>` labels (`cze_on_ger`); `sc_justify` only covers the
  aggressor's justifications.
- Every target tag in a label must be a real tag the arc seeds
  (`sandbox_set_targets`). Romania is `ROM`, never `ROU`.

### Join lever

The lever sends `sc_offer` to the top-2 pool candidates. Accepting is
Honor-free (`sandbox_honor_skip_leave_faction`), grants **mutual military
access** with the aggressor and the `scenario_ally` opinion modifier, and logs
`sc_join`. **No faction is formed.** Making the aggressor a faction leader locks
it out of its own war focuses, several of which require `is_in_faction = no`
(`ITA_pact_of_steel`, `ITA_italy_first`, `GER_integrate_czechoslovakia`,
`JAP_sea_pressure_siam`); an observer session showed Italy reaching
`ITA_foreign_affairs` and then stalling for six years, unable to open the
`italian_irredentism` path to war.

## Acceptance checklist

Log-first. Observer sandbox. Tick only when the grep holds.

- [ ] Startup: exactly one `sc_pick` naming one pool arc, plus one `sc_variant`.
- [ ] Ladder phases logged on schedule: `sc_phase smolder`, `crises`, `peak`.
- [ ] At peak each target logs one `sc_target` status line.
- [ ] Ignition: `sc_ignite` + `sc_success` + `sc_end` when a war fires between
  declared enemies (direct or ongoing).
- [ ] Derail: `sc_derail` + `sc_end` with a reason; random repicks.
- [ ] No `error.log` lines attributable to scenario files.

Observer note (first vanilla session, `italian` / variant a / YUG+GRE): phases
ran on schedule, the chosen variant was honoured, and the join lever fired
(`sc_offer` -> `sc_join`). The arc then hung at peak for a full year with no
`sc_ignite`, `sc_success` or `sc_derail`: both ultimatums were defied and the
defy option only adds war support, so ignition depends on the AI justifying on
its own. The betrayal exemption (F1) and the `sc_justify` / `sc_goal_end` /
`sc_focus` telemetry were missing from the vanilla port and are now wired;
a peak that outlives the ladder is still undetected and is an open item.

Observer note (second vanilla session, `japanese` / variant a / CHI+PHI): the
new `sc_focus` telemetry showed Japan completing **zero** war focuses over four
years while the arc sat at peak. Cause: the port boosted only the war leafs and
one or two roots, so nearly every leaf sat behind an unboosted prerequisite
(the ideological fork `JAP_sea_purge_the_kodoha_faction` XOR
`JAP_revere_the_emperor_destroy_the_traitors` for Japan, the Africa path for
Italy, `reorganize_the_wehrmacht` for Germany, `the_comintern` for the USSR,
`no_further_appeasement` for Britain, `intervention_in_asia` for the USA). The
AI never commits to the gate, so the leaf is never *available* and the boost on
it does nothing. `boost_focus_ancestors.py` now boosts the transitive ancestor
closure of every key focus (63 focuses), and `sc_focus` logging was extended to
match, so a dead gate is visible in the log rather than silent.

Observer note (third vanilla session, `japanese` -> `axis` repick): the peak
timeout worked as designed. Japan held at peak from 1938.1, both ultimatums were
submitted, the join lever fired (GER and SOV joined), and on 1939.1 the arc
derailed with `sc_derail peak_timeout` and repicked to `axis`. The axis arc then
compressed its ladder (crises and peak on consecutive ticks) and reached peak
with CZE/POL ultimatums and JAP/HUN joiners within a month. `sc_focus` showed
zero lines: the gate `is_scenario_actor` called the aggressor branch without
parentheses, so the compiler dropped it and only targets could log; fixed.

l10n note: `99_sandbox_l_english.yml` must stay UTF-8 **with BOM**. HOI4
silently drops a localisation file without it, and every string falls back to
its raw key (the leader-personality tooltip is the tell). The event-key
generator writes with `utf-8-sig` for this reason. Separately, every key the
engine points at must exist: the `scenario_ally` opinion modifier was missing
and surfaced as a raw key in the diplomacy tooltip. Game-rule
`option = sandbox_<arc>` ids are not l10n keys and need no entry.

## Out of scope for this iteration

- Flip and imperial arcs (DLC-gated focus branches in vanilla; they live in the
  Rt56 overlay).
- The full 28-arc catalog: only the content-portable subset ships here (six
  arcs plus the USA draft).
- Player-facing scenario UI beyond the pinning game rule.
- Concurrent arcs.
- Scenario behaviour in historical mode: sandbox-only.
